Exploratory Data Analysis in B2B marketing with Python
----------------

### Goal of the project

Just like other industries, B2B SaaS marketing team are benefiting from data analyis more than before. Olist - an e-commerce platform in Brazil that connect between small and medium business (sellers) with top marketplaces in the country, is not an exception. 
We found the datasets on Kaggle donated by Olist team. Therefore, this is a good opportunity for us to provide useful insights for Olist Marketing team using Data visualization on the dataset.I also discuss some important elements for B2B marketing. 
The scope of the project is only data visualization/exploratory data analysis without modeling.

### Thought Process
There several important marketing elements in B2B marketing funnel, including:
- Messaging
- Channels
- Target audience
These elements will determine the numrber of MQL Olist will capture. Moreover, Olist also should think about the performance of the sellers on Olist platform to fine-tune their marketing strategy.
